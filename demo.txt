GitHub

GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service.
 It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control 
and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. 

Software is at the heart of GitHub—and code is the DNA of software
